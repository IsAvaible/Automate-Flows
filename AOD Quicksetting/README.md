# Keep Awake Quick Tile
This flow adds a Quicksetting to toggle the AOD state. 
To be able to use this script one needs to add a unused quicksetting tile in the quicksetting section and follow the steps described in this article (https://llamalab.com/automate/doc/adb.html) to enable modifying secure settings.
The script might not work on non-stock android devices and was only tested on the Pixel 3a.
